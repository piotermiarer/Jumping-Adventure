To run it on your computer download whole folder. Use one of two executable files: main_linux or main_windows.exe. You can also prepare executable files by yourself. In order to do so compile main.cpp using a command which is written on the bottom of main.cpp. You will need gcc and Allegro 5 installed.
This is my first game. Graphics are not great, actually they are really bad. There are several bugs in game but I think I will not fix them.
If you want to cheat you can edit winners.txt and config.cfg files.
Have fun!
